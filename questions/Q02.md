## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

In computer programming, 1 . Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data (more specifically, a sequence of 8-bit bytes) in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.


A binary-to-text encoding is encoding of data in plain text. More precisely, it is an encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters. 2 .These encodings are necessary for transmission of data when the channel does not allow binary data.

The meaning of secret base64 encoded on jwt.io is actually, that it treats the secret you provide as base64encoded and therefore first decodes it, before it is actually used. The point is not to create anything different, but just to decode the secret when it is encoded.
